# Jobright Autofill — 1.19.0 base + full CSV auto-apply automation

Unpacked Chrome extension (Manifest V3) built on the **official Jobright Autofill
1.19.0** patch (last updated 2026-08-03), with a fully automated, unattended
bulk-apply queue layered on top. Jobright's own UI, autofill engine and background
worker are shipped **unmodified** — the automation is additive.

## What changed in this build

### Rebased onto the 1.19.0 patch (was 1.16.0)

| | 1.16.0 | 1.19.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contents.d42e7fcf.js` | 3.2 MB monolith | 14 KB bootstrap that lazy-loads the helper app |
| `helper-app.41ea2652.js` | 6.0 MB | 6.6 MB |
| `answer.d77729c7.js`, `dom.ed166d80.js` | present | **removed by Jobright** — deleted here too |
| permissions | — | `webNavigation` added |
| content script timing | `document_idle` | `document_start` |

The DOM anchors the automation hooks into (`#jobright-helper-id`,
`.jobright-helper-content-container`, `.auto-fill-button`, the `plasmo-csui`
shadow host) all still exist in 1.19.0, so the enhancement layer attaches exactly
as before.

### The CSV queue now runs in the service worker

This is the big one. The orchestrator used to live inside the side-panel page
(`ua-queue.html`). **Chrome destroys a side-panel document the moment the panel is
closed**, which meant closing the panel — or Chrome collapsing it — killed the run
mid-way: job tabs were left open, jobs sat on `applying` forever, and nothing ever
opened the next one.

The engine now lives in `ua-orchestrator.js`, loaded into Jobright's background
service worker by a single appended `importScripts()` line. All run state is in
`chrome.storage.local` and a 1-minute `chrome.alarms` heartbeat rebuilds it, so a
run survives:

- closing the Queue Manager panel or tab,
- the service worker being torn down for idleness and restarted,
- a job tab being closed by hand (that job goes back to `pending` and refills),
- a page that hangs (per-job watchdog, default 6 min, configurable).

`ua-queue.html` / `ua-queue.js` is now purely a view.

### Assignment is pull-based, not push-only

A job tab used to wait for the worker to *push* it its assignment. On a fast ATS
page reached through two redirects, every push could land before the content
script booted, and the job then sat idle until the watchdog killed it. Each tab now
**asks** the worker "which job am I?" by tab id (`UA_MGR_WHOAMI`) — correct no
matter how many times the page redirected on the way there. Pushes and the
`window.name` tag remain as belt-and-braces; a per-job guard means a job is never
driven twice.

### Fixes

| Fix | Symptom it caused |
| --- | --- |
| RFC-4180 CSV parser with delimiter sniffing (`, ; \t \|`) and BOM stripping | quoted cells (`"Engineer, Backend"`) split into a bogus second "URL"; Chrome percent-encoded it and Workday answered **HTTP 406**. Semicolon exports from European Excel imported as one giant cell |
| Multi-round apply-target probe (`probeApplyTarget`) | jobs marked **"No application form found"** while the tab was still redirecting from Jobright to the ATS — silently dropped, never retried |
| `http(s)`-only URL validation everywhere a URL is queued, rendered or navigated to | a `javascript:` cell in a CSV became a clickable link on a privileged extension page and a `tabs.create` target |
| HTML-escaped queue rendering in the on-page sidebar | a crafted CSV title injected markup into the page through `innerHTML` |
| Identical URL normalisation in all three components | the same posting added from a CSV row and from right-click "add this page" counted as two jobs and got applied to twice |
| Coalesced slot refills in the worker | two jobs finishing at the same instant left a slot empty until the next watchdog tick |
| Serialized read-modify-write on the queue | a slow writer holding a stale array reverted a sibling tab's result ("finished, then back to pending") |
| `sendResponse` called synchronously for `UA_ASSIGN_JOB` | the worker's callback hung until the port closed, so assignment retries looked like failures |
| Terminal status reported over runtime messaging *and* storage, de-duplicated on `(id, ts)` | a result lost when the worker was mid-restart stalled the whole run |

### Improvements

- **Pause / Resume** a run — in-flight jobs finish, no new tabs open.
- **Concurrency up to 8** parallel background tabs (was 5).
- **Drag & drop** a CSV anywhere on the panel; **Paste URLs** dialog for a quick list.
- **Per-run settings** in the panel: skip already-applied, tailor resume, per-job timeout.
- **Import feedback** — `added / duplicates / already applied / invalid`, not just a count.
- **Log survives** the panel closing (kept in storage, 200-line ring buffer).
- **Clickable stat tiles** filter the table; per-row **retry**; table capped at 400 rows so a 5,000-row CSV doesn't lock the panel.
- **Context menu** (right-click any page): open the Queue Manager in the side panel or a tab, add the current page or a link to the queue.
- **Desktop notification** when a run finishes.
- Export includes `startedAt` and `duration`, with a BOM so Excel opens it cleanly.

## Using the CSV queue

1. Right-click any page → **Jobright Queue Manager (side panel)** — or use the
   **🗂 Queue Manager** button in Jobright's own sidebar.
2. **⬆ Import CSV** (or drop the file on the panel, or **✎ Paste URLs**).
3. Pick how many tabs run at once, tick your options, hit **▶ Start**.

Jobs open in **background tabs**, so you can keep browsing. For each URL the
automation navigates to the job, clicks Apply if needed, creates or signs into the
ATS account, runs Jobright's autofill, fills any gaps, commits location/typeahead
fields, submits, and **verifies the submission was confirmed** before the job counts
as `done`. Unconfirmed submissions are marked `failed`, never a false "applied".

### CSV format

One job URL per row. Everything below imports correctly:

```csv
url,title,company
https://boards.greenhouse.io/acme/jobs/123,"Engineer, Backend",Acme
https://jobs.lever.co/acme/456,Product Manager,Acme
```

```csv
Company;Position;Apply Link
Acme;Engineer;https://acme.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/x/job/123
```

```
https://boards.greenhouse.io/acme/jobs/123
https://jobs.lever.co/acme/456
```

- Header row is auto-detected and skipped; a `url` / `link` / `apply link` /
  `job url` column is used if present, otherwise the URL is found in any cell.
- Comma, semicolon, tab and pipe delimiters; quoted cells with commas or newlines;
  UTF-8 BOM — all handled.
- Duplicates, previously-applied jobs (optional) and non-`http(s)` rows are
  reported and dropped.

### Keyboard

| Where | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Queue Manager | `S` | Start / stop |
| Queue Manager | `P` | Pause / resume |
| Queue Manager | `/` | Focus search |
| Any job page | `Alt+S` | Start / stop the in-page runner |
| Any job page | `Alt+P` | Pause / resume |
| Any job page | `Alt+J` | Add this page to the queue |
| Any job page | `Alt+F` | Manual fill pass |

## Two ways to run a queue

- **Queue Manager (recommended)** — parallel background tabs, driven by the service
  worker, survives everything. Use this for large CSV runs.
- **In-page runner** — the older single-tab mode in Jobright's sidebar
  (**Start Applying**), which navigates the tab you're in so you can watch each
  application happen. Still supported and fixed; the two are mutually exclusive and
  starting the manager stops the in-page runner.

## Tests

```bash
./tests/run.sh
```

71 assertions, no browser required: JS syntax for everything shipped, manifest
validity (including that every referenced file exists and the worker imports the
orchestrator), CSV/URL parsing in all three places it happens, and the queue engine
driven end to end — slot filling, results, duplicate results, requeue on tab close,
watchdog timeout, pause/resume, and a simulated service-worker restart mid-run.

Re-run it after dropping in a future Jobright patch: it will tell you immediately if
the new bundle removed a file the manifest still points at, or if the appended
`importScripts` line was lost.

## Applying the next Jobright patch

1. Copy the new `contents.*.js`, `helper-app.*.js`, `global.*.css`,
   `static/background/index.js`, `inter.*.css`, `scroll-to-anchor.*.js` and icons over.
2. Re-apply the manifest patch: `ua-enhancement.js` as the **first** content script
   (`document_start`, `all_frames: false`); `ua-enhancement.js`, `ua-queue.html`,
   `ua-queue.js` in `web_accessible_resources`; `side_panel.default_path` =
   `ua-queue.html`; permissions `sidePanel`, `alarms`, `contextMenus`, `notifications`.
3. Re-append to `static/background/index.js`:
   ```js
   try { importScripts("/ua-orchestrator.js"); } catch (e) { console.warn("[UA] orchestrator failed to load", e); }
   ```
4. `./tests/run.sh`

## Notes

- 150+ ATS platforms (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, SmartRecruiters, iCIMS, Ashby,
  Workable, LinkedIn/Indeed Easy Apply…), multi-page forms, shadow DOM and iframes.
- Check **Your Autofill Information** in Jobright before a large run — name, phone,
  **city**, work authorisation — the autofill is only as good as that profile.
- Resume tailoring is **off** by default: Jobright's generator can stall on
  *"Opening resume generator…"*. Turn it on per run in the panel if you want it.
- A visible CAPTCHA pauses that job rather than failing it, so you can solve it.
